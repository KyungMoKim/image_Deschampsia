# Image process for estimating body weight of Deschampsia antarctica
1. Climate has changed faster in Antarctica.
2. Life in Antarctica has already experienced environmental changes that we will experience tens of years later. 
3. It is important to study how life in Antarctica respond to the changes.
4. This understanding will give us how we have to respond to global warming in near future. 
5. The first step is to understand how Deschampsia antarctica (one of two flowering plants in Antarctica) responds to given environemntal conditions. 
6. We need to monitor whether or not this plant grows up, persist or is being dead under certain environmental conditions. 
7. This monitoring should be conducted across multiple years. 
8. It is impossible to measure fresh or dry weight of the plant body. 
9. We here apply image-based estimation of body wieght, which is an eco-friendly, non-destructive way.
10. Taking photos of D. antarctica followed by counting green pixels could provide another measure of the plant body weight.
11. This function needs to be run in either a PC or a smart phone.
